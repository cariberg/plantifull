This is vegan comfort food at its finest – hearty and warming – but also delicious and fancy-seeming enough to serve to guests. Even omnivores will love this savory risotto-inspired dish. This one is a bit time-consuming as recipes using whole farro can be. As a time saver, you could use canned pureed butternut squash (which I didn’t even know was a thing until recently – what a time to be alive!) instead of roasting and pureeing your own – however, you’ll miss out on topping the final dish with extra roasted squash.

We loved [Laura Wright’s original creation](https://thefirstmess.com/2016/11/23/creamy-vegan-farrotto-butternut-squash-recipe/) (the cracking technique for farro is genius!) and have made some simple tweaks to it, including the addition of roasted chickpeas for protein.

Summary of steps:

1. Roast the squash (unless using pre-made or canned puree)
2. Begin cooking the farro while in parallel preparing the butternut miso puree
3. Roast the chickpeas while the farro finishes cooking

</div><div class="recipe-card-directions">### Directions

- Preheat the oven to 400°F.
- In a small bowl, pour hot water to cover the 1/3 cup cashews and let sit.
- Peel the butternut squash, cut in half lengthwise, and scoop out the seeds. Cut into ~3/4″ thick slices and toss those in a tbsp. or two of olive oil. Bake the squash at 400°F for 25-30 minutes or until soft when poked with a fork. Leave the oven on as you’ll be roasting the chickpeas in a bit.
- Combine the 4 cups vegetable stock and 1 cup of water in a medium saucepan, cover, and bring to a simmer.
- Place 3/4 cup of the farro in a high-speed blender and grind on high until the grains are cracked into smaller pieces. Be careful not to overdo it or you’ll just end up with flour.
- In a large pot or dutch oven, heat a tbsp. of olive oil on medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the shallots and stir, cooking for about 2 minutes or until they become soft. Add the garlic and half of the thyme (about 2 sprigs’ worth) and stir, cooking for another 30 seconds or so.
- Add all the farro – both whole and cracked – and stir for another 3 minutes. Then add 1/4 cup of water plus the 1/4 cup lemon juice and stir until the liquid is mostly evaporated. Carefully pour the warmed vegetable stock from its saucepan into the pot with the farro. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer, cover, and let cook for 20 minutes.
- While the farro is cooking, prepare the butternut puree: Retrieve 1 cup of roasted squash (or 1 cup of puree) and place in a high-speed blender. Drain the cashews and add these to the blender along with the miso, nutritional yeast, 1/2 tsp. salt, a few grinds of pepper, and 1 cup of water. Blend on high until the mixture is smooth. Taste and add salt or pepper as desired.
- When the 20 minutes are up, remove the lid from the pot and stir the farro. Let cook for another 20 minutes with the lid off, stirring occasionally.
- While the farro continues to cook, prepare the chickpeas: Toss chickpeas in a tbsp. of olive oil, 1/2 tsp. of salt, 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper, and the remaining minced thyme (about 2 sprigs’ worth). Move onto a baking sheet and roast in the 400°F oven for 25-30 minutes, until crispy but not dried out.
- After the farro has cooked for a total of 40 minutes, add the butternut puree and stir to combine. Add 1/2 tsp. salt and some generous grinds of pepper and simmer uncovered for another 20 minutes (last one, I promise!). Stir regularly and remove from heat once the grains are tender and surrounded by a thick and creamy sauce.
- Top the farrotto with extra roasted squash, roasted chickpeas, and a few grinds of pepper.
