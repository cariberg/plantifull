Breakfast has always been my favorite meal of the day, but when we started eating plant-based I struggled to find good savory breakfast options. As much as I’d love to have pancakes, oatmeal, or granola every day, there was still a savory, salty breakfast void in my life that I couldn’t fill with chickpea eggs and quiches, savory breakfast porridge, or anything else. I’d almost given up on finding an answer and then my sister sent us the recipe for this tofu scramble. It’s truly the best plant-based scrambled egg substitute I’ve ever had. And, the fact that it’s so easy to make means it’s become our go-to weekend breakfast or brunch option. The tofu scramble itself is also delicious in tacos (breakfast or otherwise) and fried rice.

You could easily swap in other veggies in place of those in this recipe – I’d love to hear what you make!

### Ingredients

- 1/2 medium sweet potato, diced
- 1/2 green bell pepper, diced
- 1/2 yellow onion, diced
- 1 1/2 cups chopped kale
- 1 12-oz. block of extra firm tofu
- 1/2 tsp. turmeric
- 1/2 tsp. garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp. onion powder
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1 tbsp. nutritional yeast
- 1 tbsp. tahini paste
- 2 tbsp. soy, almond, or other non-dairy milk
- Avocado oil

### Directions

1. Drain and press the tofu. While it is pressing, dice the veggies.
2. Mix together the spices, salt, nutritional yeast, tahini, and non-dairy milk to form a paste. Set aside.
3. Heat a tbsp. of oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the veggies and cover. Cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring every few minutes, until the potatoes are soft. Add the kale and cover, cooking for another minute or two until kale has wilted.
4. Using your hands, break and crumble the tofu into the prepared spice paste. Mix well, ensuring the tofu is evenly coated.
5. Add tofu to the pan with the veggies and cook uncovered for another 5-7 minutes, stirring, until the tofu is browning.
6. Serve with avocado toast and sriracha or your favorite hot sauce.
