I’m not ashamed to say that the chickpea is my favorite legume. Part of this is due to its extreme versatility as the foundation of some of my absolute favorite foods: hummus, chickpea salads, roasted chickpeas, falafel, chana masala, not to mention magical aquafaba. It’s also just a great bean – flavorful, luscious, and yes, versatile.

This warming, hearty stew leans heavily on the chickpea and comes together quickly on a weeknight as a main course over your grain of choice. It also keeps and reheats well as a meal prep option for lunch. The garlicky, paprika-y harissa makes the dish pop; you can use your own harissa, but be careful if it’s a spicy blend as the one in this recipe is mild.

### Ingredients

**For the lablabi**
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 tsp. cumin seeds
- 1 tsp. paprika
- 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup crushed tomatoes
- 6 cups cooked chickpeas
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper

**For the harissa**
- 2 tbsp. paprika
- 2 tsp. garlic, minced
- 3 tbsp. water
- 3 tbsp. olive oil
- 1/2 tsp. white vinegar
- Up to 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper, to taste

### Directions

1. Heat a few tbsp. of olive oil in a large pot or dutch oven over medium heat. When hot, add the diced onion and stir. Then reduce heat to low and cover, letting cook for 12-15 minutes. Check and stir the onions intermittently, sprinkling in a few tsp. of water and/or lowering the heat if they are beginning to stick to the pot or brown too quickly.
2. When the onions are tender and just beginning to brown, add the 2 tsp. cumin seeds, 1 tsp. paprika, 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, and minced garlic and stir, letting cook for another minute. Add the crushed tomatoes, 1 1/2 tsp. salt, the chickpeas, and 4 cups of water or reserved chickpea cooking liquid. Simmer the stew for 20 minutes.
3. While lablabi is simmering, prepare the harissa: mix together all ingredients into a paste, adjusting seasonings to taste.
4. Once the stew has simmered for 20 minutes, use an immersion blender to partially puree it, leaving about half of the chickpeas whole. Taste for seasonings and add more water if you’d like the stew thinner.
5. Serve the lablabi over your choice of grain – we love millet with this – and with a generous swirl of harissa on top.
