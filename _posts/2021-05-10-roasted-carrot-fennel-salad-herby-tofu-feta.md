We love this dish for its light summery vibes yet substantial nutrition, and often serve it as a side at barbecues or other warm weather gatherings. It comes together quickly, is great served warm / cold / room temperature, and can be made in advance, adding the walnuts just before serving. Inspiration for the dish came from an original recipe in Alison Roman’s [Dining In](https://www.alisoneroman.com/dining-in), and the tofu feta is inspired by a recipe from from another favorite book, Joe Yonan’s [Cool Beans](https://www.joeyonan.com/my-books/).

### Ingredients

**For the salad**
- 1 fennel bulb
- 1 bunch carrots plus their tops (if you don’t have the tops, substitute 1 1/2 cups fresh parsley)
- 1 bunch scallions
- 2 tbsp. fresh lemon juice
- 1/2 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped (the original recipe calls for pistachios, which are also delicious here)
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper

**For the tofu feta**
- 1/2 of a 14-oz package of firm tofu, drained
- 2 tbsp. fresh lemon juice
- 1/2 tsp. apple cider vinegar
- 1 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tbsp. miso paste
- 1 tbsp. nutritional yeast
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/2 tsp. dried rosemary
- 1/2 tsp. dried oregano
- Leaves from 1 sprig fresh thyme, minced
- A few grinds of black pepper

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
2. Prepare the veggies: cut the carrots, fennel, and scallions into sticks or wedges 2-3 inches long and about 1/2 inch thick. Toss in a few tbsp. of olive oil and spread onto a baking sheet. Roast for 20-25 minutes or until the veggies are nicely browned. Remove and let cool to room temp.
3. While the veggies roast, cut the drained tofu into small (~1/2 inch) cubes.
4. Mix together the rest of the ingredients for the tofu feta to form a paste. Fold the tofu gently into the mixture, coating all the cubes.
5. Spread the tofu out onto a silicone baking mat or parchment paper on a baking sheet. Bake for 12-15 minutes in the 400°F oven. Remove and let cool.
6. Finely chop the carrot tops or parsley.
7. Once the veggies have cooled, combine them in a bowl with the carrot tops/parsley, lemon juice, a few tbsp. of olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Fold in the tofu feta.
8. Just before serving, add the toasted walnuts.
