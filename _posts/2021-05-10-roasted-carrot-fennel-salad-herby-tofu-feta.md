We love this dish for its light summery vibes yet substantial nutrition, and often serve it as a side at barbecues or other warm weather gatherings. It comes together quickly, is great served warm / cold / room temperature, and can be made in advance, adding the walnuts just before serving. Inspiration for the dish came from an original recipe in Alison Roman’s [Dining In](https://www.alisoneroman.com/dining-in), and the tofu feta is inspired by a recipe from from another favorite book, Joe Yonan’s [Cool Beans](https://www.joeyonan.com/my-books/).

Summary of steps:

1. Roast the veggies
2. Prepare and bake the tofu feta
3. Assemble the dish

</div><div class="recipe-card-directions">### Directions

- Preheat the oven to 400°F.
- Prepare the veggies: cut the carrots, fennel, and scallions into sticks or wedges 2-3 inches long and about 1/2 inch thick. Toss in a few tbsp. of olive oil and spread onto a baking sheet. Roast for 20-25 minutes or until the veggies are nicely browned. Remove and let cool to room temp.
- While the veggies roast, cut the drained tofu into small (~1/2 inch) cubes.
- Mix together the rest of the ingredients for the tofu feta to form a paste. Fold the tofu gently into the mixture, coating all the cubes.
- Spread the tofu out onto a silicone baking mat or parchment paper on a baking sheet. Bake for 12-15 minutes in the 400°F oven. Remove and let cool.
- Finely chop the carrot tops or parsley.
- Once the veggies have cooled, combine them in a bowl with the carrot tops/parsley, lemon juice, a few tbsp. of olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Fold in the tofu feta.
- Just before serving, add the toasted walnuts.
