One of many of our go-to recipes from [Laura Wright’s First Mess](https://thefirstmess.com/the-first-mess-cookbook/) cookbook, this vegan dish perfectly captures the creamy cheesiness of risotto. It also gives me an excuse to eat crispy roasted brassicas directly off the baking sheet (truly one of my most favorite activities) while the risotto finishes. The only modification we make to this recipe is to sometimes double it, particularly if we’re cooking for 4 or more people, as it can feel a bit light. It’s also great alongside a substantial veg side such as this roasted carrot and fennel salad.

### Ingredients

- 6 cups total of a mix of broccoli florets + halved or quartered brussels sprouts
- 2 cups cannellini or other white bean, cooked
- 1 tbsp. fresh lemon juice
- 1/2 tsp. nutritional yeast
- 2 1/3 cup vegetable stock or water (\*see note)
- 4 shallots, diced
- 2 tsp. minced fresh thyme leaves
- 1 cup quinoa
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
2. Toss the broccoli and brussels sprouts in a few tbsp. of olive oil and spread out onto a baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper and roast for 20-25 minutes or until nice and crispy. Set aside.
3. While the veggies are roasting, prepare the white bean puree: combine the 2 cups white beans, 1 tbsp. lemon juice, 1/2 tsp. nutritional yeast, 2 tsp. olive oil, and 1/3 cup of the vegetable stock in a high-speed blender or food processor. Puree until smooth and then set aside.
4. In a large pot or dutch oven, heat a tbsp. of olive oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and saute for 3-4 minutes until soft. Add the thyme and stir, cooking for another minute.
5. Add the quinoa to the pot and stir to coat, then add the remaining 2 cups of vegetable stock. Bring the pot to a boil and then reduce to a simmer, cooking for about 15 minutes or until the quinoa has absorbed almost all of the liquid.
6. Add the white bean puree to the quinoa and stir to combine. Taste for seasonings, adding salt (start with 3/4 tsp. and adjust from there) and pepper as desired. Add half the parsley to the quinoa and stir to combine.
7. Serve quinoa topped with roasted veggies and parsley to garnish.

**Notes**

- Note on vegetable stock: the original recipe calls for vegetable stock, but this is one (of many) recipes where I feel there is enough flavor from the other components that water can substitute one for one without losing out on much.
