Learning how to dabble in cooking Indian food has been one of my favorite outcomes of going plant-based. I’ve always loved the complexity of the spices in Indian cooking, and it’s been really fun to play around with different source recipes to hone in on what works best for our tastes. This dish is a crowd pleaser and also a pretty quick option for a weeknight dinner. Instead of traditional paneer cheese, we use tofu as the protein but we also love to mix and match other protein or hearty vegetable options such as chickpeas, mushrooms, and cubed potatoes. This adaptation is based on [Aarti Sequeira’s original](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/aarti-sequeira/saag-paneer1-1927603).

Summary of steps:

1. Thaw and puree spinach
2. Marinate tofu (and/or mushrooms, chickpeas, potatoes)
3. Cook saag curry
4. Cook tofu (and/or mushrooms, chickpeas, potatoes) and add to the curry

</div><div class="recipe-card-directions">### Directions

- Place the spinach in a microwave-safe dish and thaw in the microwave for about 5 minutes on high until there are no frozen bits left. Then transfer it to the bowl of a food processor and puree until smooth. Set aside.
- Mix together the 2 tsp. turmeric, 1 tsp. cayenne pepper, 3 tbsp. olive oil, and 2 tsp. of salt. Divide the marinade into two mixing bowls. Place the tofu in one bowl and the chickpeas in the other and toss to coat in the marinade. (If using potatoes or mushrooms to substitute, do the same in separate bowls).
- In a large heavy pot, heat a tbsp. of olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and cover, cooking on low-medium for about 15 minutes until lightly browning. Stir occasionally throughout this time, adding water if needed toward the end to keep it from burning.
- Add the garlic, ginger, and spices – garam masala, coriander, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon – and stir for a minute or two, adding a bit of water if needed to prevent burning.
- Add the pureed spinach, coconut milk, and 3/4 cup of water and stir to combine. Cook for another 5-10 minutes, stirring frequently. Add salt – start with 1 tsp. – and pepper to taste.
- While the saag is finishing cooking, in a frying pan over medium-high heat, cook the tofu for about 5 minutes, tossing throughout to ensure roughly even browning. Remove the tofu and repeat with the chickpeas (or mushrooms or potatoes – note potatoes will need more time to fully cook).
- Add the cooked tofu and chickpeas to the spinach curry and stir to combine.
- Serve the curry over rice or with naan.

</div><div class="recipe-card-notes">### Notes

- 1. If using mushrooms or potatoes instead, substitute 3 cups chopped mushrooms or 3 cups cubed potato (such as Yukon Gold) for either or both the tofu and chickpeas
- 2. Flatbread is not included in the nutrition facts calculations.
