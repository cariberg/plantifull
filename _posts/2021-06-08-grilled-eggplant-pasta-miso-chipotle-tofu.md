Last weekend we picked asparagus at the [farm](https://www.monroefarm.com/) where we are CSA members and ended up bringing home about 12 lbs!! Fun fact we learned: asparagus can apparently grow 4-6 inches per day in the springtime. Our favorite way to enjoy really fresh asparagus is on the grill – it’s simple but really brings out the sweetness while maintaining a good crunch. We served the asparagus alongside our favorite mains from the grill – sun-dried tomato pesto pasta salad ([adapted from Smitten Kitchen](https://smittenkitchen.com/2016/06/charred-eggplant-and-walnut-pesto-pasta-salad/)) and miso-chipotle grilled tofu ([a Serious Eats original](https://www.seriouseats.com/grilled-tofu-chipotle-miso-recipe)).

Summary of steps:

1. Marinate the tofu
2. Prepare veggies for grilling
3. Cook pasta
4. Grill tofu and veggies
5. Make walnut pesto and assemble pasta salad

</div><div class="recipe-card-directions">### Directions

- Press the tofu to remove water. Meanwhile, mix together the miso paste, chipotle pepper and adobo sauce, oil, brown sugar, sesame oil, and soy sauce. Slice the tofu into ~1/2 inch slabs and place in a single layer in a dish. Cover with the marinade, being sure to coat all sides of the tofu. Set aside.
- Trim the asparagus to remove any tough ends. Toss in a tbsp. of olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
- Cut the eggplant into ~1/2 inch rounds. Brush each side with some olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
- Bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the pasta according to the instructions. Once done, drain and set aside.
- On a grill, cook the tofu for about 7 minutes on each side. Cook the eggplant rounds for about 4 minutes on each side. Cook the asparagus for about 5 minutes or until cooked to your liking. When done, set aside.
- Prepare the sun-dried tomato pesto: in a food processor, combine the walnuts, nutritional yeast, garlic, thyme, vinegar, olive oil, and sun-dried tomatoes and process until you have a paste. Add salt and pepper to taste, and more olive oil if you like a thinner pesto.
- Chop the eggplant rounds into pieces and combine with the pasta. Add the pesto and toss or use kitchen tongs to gently combine. Add the chopped basil at the end, and season with more salt, pepper, or olive oil as desired.
- Serve a tofu steak alongside a helping of pasta salad and asparagus.
