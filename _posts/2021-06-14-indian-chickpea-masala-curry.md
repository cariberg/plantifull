This is one of the simplest recipes we make, involving very few steps (as you’ll see below) and mostly pantry ingredients, but it’s a favorite nonetheless – filling from the chickpeas hearty with coconut milk and spices. Inspiration came from a curry recipe on [Smitten Kitchen](https://smittenkitchen.com/2019/10/chicken-curry/). We enjoy this curry over rice and alongside a roasted vegetable in the winter, or a fresh salad in summer (it’s pictured here with a lovely shaved asparagus salad courtesy of Bryant Terry’s [Vegetable Kingdom](https://www.bryant-terry.com/allbooks)).

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 2 yellow onions, diced
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tbsp. grated ginger
- 1 tsp. cumin seeds
- 2 tbsp. tomato paste
- 1.5 tsp. ground turmeric
- 1 tsp. garam masala
- 1 tbsp. ground coriander
- 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
- 6 cups cooked chickpeas
- 1 15-oz. can of crushed tomatoes
- 1 14-oz. can unsweetened coconut milk
- Avocado oil
- Salt
- Cooked rice or other grain for serving

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Heat a tbsp. of avocado oil in a large, heavy pot over medium heat. Add the onions and cover, cooking for 10-12 minutes or until the onions are beginning to brown. Stir occasionally, adding water or lowering the heat if the onions are sticking or burning at all.
2. Add the garlic, ginger, cumin seeds, and tomato paste and stir, cooking for another minute or so. Then add the remaining spices and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant.
3. Add the chickpeas, crushed tomatoes, coconut milk, and 1 tsp. of salt and stir to combine. Add water at this point if you’d like a thinner sauce in the curry. Simmer for another 5-10 minutes.
4. Serve the curry over rice and alongside a roasted vegetable (cabbage is great) or a salad.
