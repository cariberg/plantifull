This recipe, based on Bryant Terry’s original from [Vegetable Kingdom](https://www.bryant-terry.com/allbooks), is deceptively delicious. For a seemingly simple preparation, the flavors and textures in this dish combine to create a lot of depth without feeling like a heavy meal – perfect for summer. We’ve adapted the recipe to be Instant Pot (and weeknight) friendly, and swapped in butternut squash for delicata as it tends to be easier to find at our grocery store. I’d guess that a variety of sturdy roasted options like squash or root veg would work well in this dish! To stretch this for more meals, we would serve this over a whole grain like millet.

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

**For the black-eyed peas**
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 1/2 cup celery, diced
- 1 tbsp. minced garlic
- 1 chipotle pepper (from a can), minced
- 1 bay leaf
- 1.5 cups dried black-eyed peas
- 1 tbsp. apple cider vinegar
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper

**For the squash**
- 1 medium butternut squash, peeled and halved lengthwise, seeds removed, and sliced into ~1/4 inch thick wedges
- 1 tbsp. honey or agave nectar

**For the greens**
- 3 shallots, thinly sliced
- 1 tbsp. minced garlic
- 1 pound mustard greens, stems removed and leaves cut into bite-sized pieces
- 2 cups vegetable stock
- 1 tbsp. apple cider vinegar

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Preheat the oven to 425°F.
2. Set the Instant Pot (IP) to Saute mode and heat a tbsp. of olive oil. Once hot, add the onion and celery and cook until beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, chipotle pepper, and bay leaf and cook until fragrant, another ~3 minutes.
3. Add the black-eyed peas and about 4 cups of water.
4. Put the lid on the IP and set it to to Pressure Cook mode for 25 minutes. Once the time is up, let slow release for about 10 minutes before fully releasing and removing the lid. Remove the bay leaf from the beans and stir in the vinegar. Season with salt (start with 1 tsp.) and pepper to taste.
5. While the beans are cooking, toss the squash slices in a few tbsp. of olive oil and the honey or agave. Spread onto a baking sheet and roast in the 425°F oven for about 30 minutes.
6. To make the greens, heat a few tbsp. of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once shimmering, add the shallots and saute until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and 1/4 tsp. of salt and cook for another 2 minutes.
7. Add in the greens and vegetable stock and decrease the heat to low. Simmer, partially covered, for about 25 minutes or until the greens are very tender. Stir in the vinegar and season with salt and pepper to taste.
8. Serve black-eyed peas, squash, and mustard greens together in a bowl, making sure to get some broth from the beans and greens.
