I truly can’t believe it’s taken me this long to post this hummus recipe since starting Plantifull. I’ve already extolled the virtues of the chickpea in a [previous post]({% post_url 2021-05-03-lablabi-tunisian-chickpea-stew %}), and hummus is probably the single most reliable item to be found in our fridge. I’ve made so many hummus recipes in my life but I’ve preferred this one over the past few years as it is heavier on the tahini, which I think results in a richer flavor, and also includes no additional oil because of the high tahini content.

We make this hummus in admittedly large quantities, so feel free to halve the recipe if it works better for you. Enjoy it with crackers, sliced veggies, toast, or on top of salads!

### Ingredients

- 1.5 cups dried chickpeas, soaked overnight or for ~8 hours\*
- 1/2 cup tahini paste
- 4 tbsp. fresh lemon juice
- 4 cloves garlic
- 6-10 tbsp. ice cold water
- 1.5 tsp salt

### Directions

1. Drain and rinse the soaked chickpeas. Then cook them, either in an Instant Pot as we do or on the stovetop. For Instant Pot, add enough water to cover the beans by an inch or two and cook on high pressure for about 30 minutes (time may vary depending on your chickpeas and which IP you have). Let slow release for 10 minutes before depressuring, then drain the beans. \[Note: if using canned chickpeas simply drain and rinse them\]
2. Add the garlic cloves to the bowl of a food processor and pulse to dice them. Then add the chickpeas, tahini, lemon juice, 4 tbsp. of the ice water, and salt and puree.
3. Continue to puree, drizzling in ice water slowly until the hummus has reached your desired consistency. Taste and add more salt as needed.
4. Serve with a drizzle of olive oil and a few shakes of zaatar seasoning alongside your favorite dippers or atop toasted sourdough bread.

**Notes**

- \*2 15-oz. cans of cooked chickpeas can be substituted here. When making the hummus, start with a bit less water if using canned beans.
