Since switching to a primarily plant-based diet, I’ve had a sandwich-sized hole in my stomach and heart. I LOVE good bread and sandwiches, but it is so rare to find a plant-based sandwich that is a) filling, b) nutritionally solid, and c) actually tastes good. Most of the vegan sandwiches I’ve encountered are either a sad afterthought to a pretty well thought-out meat-containing menu or they rely on plant-based meat, something I consider a once-in-awhile processed food splurge but not part of my typical diet.

This open-faced sandwich is based on a delicious lunch we had at [Bonfire Coffee](https://bonfirecoffee.com/) while traveling through Carbondale, CO on one of our summer adventures. As written here it’s made with a sun-dried tomato pesto but is equally good with a simple basil pesto and likely other spreads. We vary the ingredients up quite a bit depending on what we have handy in the fridge – let me know what variations you try!

### Ingredients

- 4 slices of sourdough or other fresh bread
- 1/4 cup [sundried tomato pesto]({% post_url 2021-06-08-grilled-eggplant-pasta-miso-chipotle-tofu %}) (or other [pesto spread]({% post_url 2021-04-02-vegetable-flatbread-pesto-almond-ricotta %}))
- 1/2 cup [hummus]({% post_url 2021-08-13-chickpea-tahini-hummus %})
- 1/2 avocado, sliced
- 1 tomato, thinly sliced
- 1 cucumber, cut in half width-wise and thinly sliced into “steaks”
- Fresh basil or other herb
- Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling
- Flaky salt such as Maldon for sprinkling

### Directions

1. Toast the bread.
2. Spread about a tbsp of pesto onto each piece of bread. Top with about 2 tbsp. of hummus and a few slices of avocado.
3. Top with sliced tomato and cucumber. Add basil or other fresh herb, drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle some salt on top.
