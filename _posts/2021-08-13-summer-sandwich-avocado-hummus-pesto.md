Since switching to a primarily plant-based diet, I’ve had a sandwich-sized hole in my stomach and heart. I LOVE good bread and sandwiches, but it is so rare to find a plant-based sandwich that is a) filling, b) nutritionally solid, and c) actually tastes good. Most of the vegan sandwiches I’ve encountered are either a sad afterthought to a pretty well thought-out meat-containing menu or they rely on plant-based meat, something I consider a once-in-awhile processed food splurge but not part of my typical diet.

This open-faced sandwich is based on a delicious lunch we had at [Bonfire Coffee](https://bonfirecoffee.com/) while traveling through Carbondale, CO on one of our summer adventures. As written here it’s made with a sun-dried tomato pesto but is equally good with a simple basil pesto and likely other spreads. We vary the ingredients up quite a bit depending on what we have handy in the fridge – let me know what variations you try!
