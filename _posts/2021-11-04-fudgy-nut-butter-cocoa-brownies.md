I’ve always had a soft spot for dessert, but eating more whole foods and plant-based over the years has definitely affected my taste for sugar. These brownies, adapted from [The First Mess cookbook](https://thefirstmess.com/the-first-mess-cookbook/), are the perfect level of rich chocolatey goodness without being overpoweringly sweet. They happen to be gluten-free as well, which makes them a great dessert to bring to potlucks or other gatherings where people may have dietary restrictions.

### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup cashew butter
- 1/2 cup almond butter
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 2 flax eggs (See Note)
- 5 tbsp. water
- 1.5 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup cocoa powder
- 3 tbsp. coconut flour
- 3/4 tsp. baking soda
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/2 cup vegan chocolate chunks, divided
- 3 tbsp. chopped almonds or other nut (optional)

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line an 8×8 baking pan with parchment, leaving an overhang on the sides. Set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, mix together the nut butters, maple syrup, flax eggs, water, and vanilla. Add the cocoa powder, coconut flour, baking soda, and salt and whisk to combine.
3. Melt half the chocolate chunks in the microwave or in a double boiler. Stir the melted chocolate into the batter until fully incorporated.
4. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing it out and making sure the corners are filled. Distribute the remaining chocolate chunks and the chopped nuts on top of the batter.
5. Bake for about 30 minutes or until the top of the brownies are slightly firm and cracks are beginning to appear.
6. Cool the brownies completely, then cover and place in the refrigerator for at least one hour before cutting. Do not skip the chilling period, as the brownies won’t cut neatly otherwise.

**Notes**
- To make two flax eggs, combine 2 tbsp. ground flaxseeds with 5 tbsp. water and let sit for a few minutes until thickened.
