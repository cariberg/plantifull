It’s soup, chili, and stew season everyone! Vegan and plant-based friends, celebrate because it’s our time to shine. Fall and winter are my favorite times to be a plant-based eater – it’s finally time to break out the warm, comforting, bean-heavy dishes that I love so much and yet can’t bear to eat in summer.

This chili is from Joe Yonan’s [Cool Beans](https://www.joeyonan.com/my-books/) and comes together quickly on a weeknight. It has a great depth of flavor from the chipotles in adobo, smoked paprika, and fresh lime juice. We serve ours over rice and with plenty of fresh avocado on top.

Summary of steps:

1. Saute aromatics
2. Add remaining ingredients and cook chili

</div><div class="recipe-card-directions">### Directions

- Peel the plantains and quarter them lengthwise. Then, slice the lengths of plantains into about 1/2 inch sections – you should end up with quarter-moons about 1/2 inch thick.
- In a heavy pot or Dutch oven, heat a few tbsp of olive oil over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Add the onions and saute for about 8 minutes or until lightly browning. Add the garlic, chipotles, cumin, paprika, and salt and cook for another minute. Stir the plantains into the pot and let cook for a few minutes.
- Add the tomatoes, beans, and 1 cup of water and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes, until the plantains are very soft. Stir in the lime juice and season with more salt or lime as desired.
- Serve atop rice and with cubed avocado on top.
