It’s soup, chili, and stew season everyone! Vegan and plant-based friends, celebrate because it’s our time to shine. Fall and winter are my favorite times to be a plant-based eater – it’s finally time to break out the warm, comforting, bean-heavy dishes that I love so much and yet can’t bear to eat in summer.

This chili is from Joe Yonan’s [Cool Beans](https://www.joeyonan.com/my-books/) and comes together quickly on a weeknight. It has a great depth of flavor from the chipotles in adobo, smoked paprika, and fresh lime juice. We serve ours over rice and with plenty of fresh avocado on top.

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 3 ripe plantains
- 1 large yellow onion, chopped
- Extra virgin olive oil
- 5 cloves garlic, chopped
- 3 chipotles in adobo (fewer if you are spice-sensitive), diced
- 2 tsp. ground cumin
- 3/4 tsp. smoked paprika
- 1 tsp. salt
- 15 oz can fire-roasted tomatoes
- 4 cups cooked black beans
- 2 tbsp. fresh lime juice
- Rice and cubed avocado for serving

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Peel the plantains and quarter them lengthwise. Then, slice the lengths of plantains into about 1/2 inch sections – you should end up with quarter-moons about 1/2 inch thick.
2. In a heavy pot or Dutch oven, heat a few tbsp of olive oil over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Add the onions and saute for about 8 minutes or until lightly browning. Add the garlic, chipotles, cumin, paprika, and salt and cook for another minute. Stir the plantains into the pot and let cook for a few minutes.
3. Add the tomatoes, beans, and 1 cup of water and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes, until the plantains are very soft. Stir in the lime juice and season with more salt or lime as desired.
4. Serve atop rice and with cubed avocado on top.
