This is one of my all-time favorite recipes, a showstopper that definitely requires some time and effort but is so worth it. I’d make this for a dinner party to impress even the most skeptical omnivores, or on any winter weekend night that calls for a bottle of red wine and a hearty, lovingly-made meal.

The original recipe is, like many of my favorites on this site, from Laura Wright’s blog [The First Mess](https://thefirstmess.com/2019/02/06/mushroom-beet-bolognese-vegan-recipe/#wprm-recipe-container-13997). I’ve made very few modifications because the original is basically perfect, but I do increase the legume quantity a bit.

Summary of steps:

1. Roast beets
2. Cook lentils
3. Saute veggies
4. Make cashew milk
5. Continue cooking the bolognese sauce
6. Cook pasta

</div><div class="recipe-card-directions">### Directions

- Roast the beets: place the cubed beets in a foil packet with a tsp. or so of olive oil and roast at 400°F for about 40 minutes, or until the beets are fork tender.
- While beets are roasting, cook the lentils. For us, this is in the Instant Pot for 6 minutes plus 10 min slow release, but you could also cook them on the stovetop. Once cooked, drain and set aside.
- Prepare the mushrooms: in a food processor with the S-blade, pulse the mushrooms until they are finely minced, about 8-10 pulses. (You can also do this by hand but it’s much easier in the food processor).
- In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, heat a tbsp of olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the onions and cook until soft, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic, chili flakes, bay leaf, and cubed beets and cook for another 5-8 minutes.
- Add the mushrooms to the pot and stir to coat. Leave them for a few minutes and then stir once they start to let off liquid. Add the cooked lentils, miso paste, tomato paste, salt, and a few generous grinds of black pepper. Keep cooking the vegetables for another 10 minutes or so, stirring at intervals.
- While the veggies cook, drain the cashews and combine them in a blender with 3/4 cup of water. Blend on high until smooth and set aside.
- To the pot of vegetables, add the red wine and stir, cooking for 5 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring often. Finally, add the cashew milk and cook for 5 more minutes. Check for seasoning here and keep the sauce on low heat.
- Make the pasta according to package directions, minus 1-2 minutes. Drain the pasta and add it to the bolognese. Cook for another few minutes until the pasta is to your liking, then stir in the parsley to serve.
