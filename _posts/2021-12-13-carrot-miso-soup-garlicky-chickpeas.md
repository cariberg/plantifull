This is one of the simplest and best soups I’ve made in a long time – it’s perfect for a quick weeknight dinner or reheated for lunch. I adapted [Smitten Kitchen’s original](https://smittenkitchen.com/2012/01/carrot-soup-with-miso-and-sesame/) and (surprise) added chickpeas! The chickpeas add some texture to the soup, which is sweet, savory, and a little spicy if you add the cayenne pepper like I did. Serve this alongside a simple roasted vegetable and a toasted piece of fresh bread and enjoy a quintessentially soup-season meal!

Summary of steps:

1. Saute veggies
2. Add broth and cook veggies
3. Saute the chickpeas and spices
4. Puree soup

</div><div class="recipe-card-directions">### Directions

- In a large soup pot, heat a few tbsp. of olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the onions and cook for 5-7 minutes until the onions are translucent but not yet browning. Add the garlic, ginger, and carrots and cook for another few minutes until the garlic is fragrant.
- Add the vegetable broth and up to 1/8 tsp. of cayenne pepper (less if you don’t like spice) and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cover, cooking for 20 minutes or until the carrots are very tender.
- While the carrots cook, make the chickpeas: Heat a large frying pan over medium heat. In a mixing bowl, toss the chickpeas in a tbsp. or so of olive oil with the garlic powder, salt, cayenne pepper, and sesame seeds. Once the pan is hot, add the chickpeas and cook for about 5 minutes, tossing frequently, until they are fragrant and slightly crispy. Turn off the heat and drizzle 2 tsp. of toasted sesame oil over the pan. Set aside.
- Combine the miso paste in a bowl with 1/2 cup of water and whisk until smooth.
- When the carrots are done, turn the heat off and add the miso-water mixture, then puree the soup using an immersion blender (you can also do this in batches in a blender – be very careful when transferring the hot soup back and forth!) Add more water at this stage if you’d like a thinner soup.
- Serve the soup topped with 1/2 cup of chickpeas, a handful of sliced scallions, and a drizzle of toasted sesame oil.
