This recipe has come together over so many iterations but I’m finally ready to share it. This pantry-ready dinner is another easy weeknight option that is perfect for fall or winter – a very hearty, spiced red lentil curry. Inspiration for this recipe came from [Meera Sodha’s original](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/29/meera-sodha-vegan-tarka-dal-recipe-maham-anjum#top), but I’ve made quite a few tweaks to it over the years. We eat this with brown rice and usually roasted cabbage, one of our easiest go-to side vegetables, but I bet it would be delicious with any number of grains or side veggies!

<h3> Ingredients </h3>
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp. ginger, grated
- 1/2 tsp. ground turmeric
- 1 tsp. chili flakes
- 4 bay leaves
- 1 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1 tsp. cumin seeds
- 1/2 tsp. black mustard seeds
- 1/2 tsp. coriander
- 1 1/2 cups dried red lentils, rinsed
- 1/2 cup crushed tomatoes from a can
- 3/4 cup coconut milk
- Extra virgin olive oil

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. In a large pot, heat a tbsp. of olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and cook for about 5-7 minutes until lightly browning. Stir occasionally throughout this time.
2. Add the garlic, ginger, and all the spices and stir, cooking for a minute or two until the spices are fragrant.
3. Add the crushed tomatoes, coconut milk, lentils, and 3 1/4 cups of water and stir. Bring to a boil, then reduce and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the lentils are cooked.
4. Serve over rice or your choice of grain.
