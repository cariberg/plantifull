This is one of our go-to winter weeknight soups – it’s hearty and warming from the sweet potatoes, coconut milk, and ginger. Best of all, it comes together quickly and with minimal clean-up thanks to the Instant Pot! The recipe is adapted for the Instant Pot with minimal changes from Laura Wright’s original slow cooker [Golden Lentil Soup](https://thefirstmess.com/2017/11/15/slow-golden-lentil-soup-recipe/#recipe "Golden Lentil Soup"). We serve this simply with toasted sourdough bread.

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 1 medium sweet potato
- 1 large onion
- 1 1/2 cups red lentils, rinsed
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp. ginger, grated
- 1 14-oz. can crushed tomatoes
- 1 14-oz. can coconut milk
- 3 1/2 cups water
- 2 tsp. ground turmeric
- 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
- 1 1/2 tsp. black or brown mustard seeds
- 1 1/2 tsp. ground cumin
- 3 bay leaves
- 3 cups fresh spinach leaves
- 1 lime
- Salt and pepper

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Using a box grater or food processor, grate or shred the sweet potato and then the onion. Add these to the Instant Pot along with all other ingredients except for the spinach and lime. (Seriously, just put everything in the ingredients list up through the bay leaves in there).
2. Stir the mixture and add 1 tsp. of salt and a few grinds of black pepper.
3. Place the lid on the Instant Pot and set to pressure cook for 6 minutes. Let slow release for another 10 minutes before releasing all pressure.
4. Stir in the lime juice and spinach leaves until the spinach is wilted. Season with additional salt and pepper before enjoying alongside toasted bread.
