Recently our household is getting over being sick and for the first time I can remember, the idea of eating whole beans has been unappealing. Based on our normal go-to recipe profile (as you can tell from this site), this is a big departure and has inspired some creativity, lots of tofu stir frys, and lots of pureeing beans to make them go down a little easier. Hence, this recipe, which is one we loved from Joe Yonan’s [Cool Beans](https://www.joeyonan.com/my-books/). I’ve adapted it to be weeknight-friendly, although the original stovetop version has a deeper flavor and is absolutely worth making if you have the time.

Summary of steps:

1. Cook black beans in the Instant Pot (see Note)
2. Make the tofu feta
3. Make the masa dumplings
4. Prep the ancho chile, avocado, and any other toppings

</div><div class="recipe-card-directions">### Directions

- Preheat the oven to 400°F.
- In an Instant Pot, combine all the ingredients for the soup and cook on high pressure for 25 minutes, followed by a 10-minute slow release. Do not drain the beans or remove any of the other add-ins. You will need everything in step 8.
- While the beans are cooking, fold together all ingredients for the tofu feta in a bowl and then spread onto a baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Bake in the oven for 12-15 minutes or until the tofu is just starting to brown. Remove and set aside.
- If using the ancho chile, place it on a baking sheet in the 400°F oven for 5 minutes or until it puffs up. Then remove from the oven, let cool, and tear open. Discard the seeds and tear or chop the flesh into small pieces.
- To make the masa dumplings, combine masa flour and salt in a stand mixer. Using the beater attachment on low speed, slowly pour in 3/4 cup of hot water until the mixture forms a dough. Add small amounts of water or flour to adjust until the dough is moist and tacky but not sticky.
- Then, turn the mixer to medium speed and add butter in ~1/2 tbsp. increments, waiting between additions until the butter is fully incorporated. Once all the butter has been added, you should have a fluffy dough. Roll ~1 tbsp. pieces of the dough into balls, then use your thumb to slightly flatten and make an indentation in the center of each one.
- Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil, then reduce to a simmer before adding the dumplings. Cook the dumplings until they float, about 2 minutes, and then remove to a bowl.
- By this time the beans should be done. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the beans, onion, garlic, and bay and avocado leaves from the Instant Pot to a high-speed blender and add 1 cup of bean cooking liquid. Puree the mixture, adding more bean cooking liquid as needed until you reach your desired consistency for the soup.
- Transfer the soup to a pot on the stove and keep warm until you are ready to serve.
- To serve, top the soup with a few dumplings, tofu feta, cubes of avocado, ancho chile crumbles, and pepitas.

- If not using an Instant Pot, cook the beans on the stove in a pot for about 1 hour or until done.
