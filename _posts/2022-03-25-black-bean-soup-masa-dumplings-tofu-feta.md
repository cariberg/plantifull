Recently our household is getting over being sick and for the first time I can remember, the idea of eating whole beans has been unappealing. Based on our normal go-to recipe profile (as you can tell from this site), this is a big departure and has inspired some creativity, lots of tofu stir frys, and lots of pureeing beans to make them go down a little easier. Hence, this recipe, which is one we loved from Joe Yonan’s [Cool Beans](https://www.joeyonan.com/my-books/). I’ve adapted it to be weeknight-friendly, although the original stovetop version has a deeper flavor and is absolutely worth making if you have the time.


<h3> Ingredients </h3>

**For the soup**
- 1 1/2 cups black beans, soaked for at least 8 hours and drained
- 1/2 yellow onion, peeled
- 1/2 head of garlic, separated into cloves and peeled
- 3 bay leaves
- 3 avocado leaves (or substitute 1 tsp. fennel seeds)
- 1 tsp. salt

- **For the tofu feta**
- 1/2 of a 14-oz package of firm tofu, drained and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 2 tbsp. fresh lemon juice
- 1/2 tsp. apple cider vinegar
- 1 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tbsp. miso paste
- 1 tbsp. nutritional yeast
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/2 tsp. dried rosemary
- 1/2 tsp. dried oregano
- 1/4 tsp. dried thyme
- A few grinds of black pepper

**For the masa dumplings**
- 1 cup masa flour
- 3 tbsp. vegan butter, at room temperature
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- Hot water

**Other toppings**
- 1 large dried ancho chile
- 1 avocado, cubed
- 1/2 cup roasted pepitas

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
2. In an Instant Pot, combine all the ingredients for the soup and cook on high pressure for 25 minutes, followed by a 10-minute slow release. Do not drain the beans or remove any of the other add-ins. You will need everything in step 8.
3. While the beans are cooking, fold together all ingredients for the tofu feta in a bowl and then spread onto a baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Bake in the oven for 12-15 minutes or until the tofu is just starting to brown. Remove and set aside.
4. If using the ancho chile, place it on a baking sheet in the 400°F oven for 5 minutes or until it puffs up. Then remove from the oven, let cool, and tear open. Discard the seeds and tear or chop the flesh into small pieces.
5. To make the masa dumplings, combine masa flour and salt in a stand mixer. Using the beater attachment on low speed, slowly pour in 3/4 cup of hot water until the mixture forms a dough. Add small amounts of water or flour to adjust until the dough is moist and tacky but not sticky.
6. Then, turn the mixer to medium speed and add butter in ~1/2 tbsp. increments, waiting between additions until the butter is fully incorporated. Once all the butter has been added, you should have a fluffy dough. Roll ~1 tbsp. pieces of the dough into balls, then use your thumb to slightly flatten and make an indentation in the center of each one.
7. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil, then reduce to a simmer before adding the dumplings. Cook the dumplings until they float, about 2 minutes, and then remove to a bowl.
8. By this time the beans should be done. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the beans, onion, garlic, and bay and avocado leaves from the Instant Pot to a high-speed blender and add 1 cup of bean cooking liquid. Puree the mixture, adding more bean cooking liquid as needed until you reach your desired consistency for the soup.
9. Transfer the soup to a pot on the stove and keep warm until you are ready to serve.
10. To serve, top the soup with a few dumplings, tofu feta, cubes of avocado, ancho chile crumbles, and pepitas.

**Notes**
- If not using an Instant Pot, cook the beans on the stove in a pot for about 1 hour or until done.
