Admittedly it’s been a long time (months, somehow) since I last posted. I’ll blame this on moving houses and busy times at work but the other equal reality is that sometimes I get in a food rut and either don’t cook anything new, cook new things that aren’t good enough to share, or forget to write down a recipe and can’t re-create it. This Thai curry is a staple for when I’m feeling uncreative or rushed, as it’s quick and crowd pleasing. You can use any variety of seasonal vegetables which makes it a great option to handle the variety from our summer CSA share. Broccoli is a favorite as it really absorbs the flavor of the curry sauce; we also love summer squash, bell peppers, and snow peas in this.


<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 1.5 cups white rice
- 1 14-oz. package of firm or extra firm tofu, pressed to remove water and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- Avocado oil
- Salt
- 1 yellow onion, large dice
- 4-6 cups of seasonal veggies, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, grated
- 1 tbsp grated ginger
- 4 tbsp red or green curry paste (such as Thai Kitchen brand)
- 1 tbsp Sriracha hot sauce
- 1 14-oz. can coconut milk
- 1.5 tbsp soy sauce or tamari
- 1 tbsp brown sugar

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Cook the rice according to the instructions.
2. Heat a tbsp of avocado oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. While it’s heating, toss the tofu cubes with 1 tsp garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp salt until coated. When the pan is hot, add the tofu and cook for 10-15 minutes total, tossing every 3-4 minutes to cook all sides.
3. Heat another tbsp of avocado oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the onion and your chopped veggies and stir. Cover the pot and let the veggies cook for 10-15 minutes or until they are soft but still retain a bit of crunch. Depending on the veggies you use, you should add them in stages – start with ones that take longer such as sweet potato or broccoli, and add things like mushrooms or green onions toward the end.
4. While everything is cooking, prepare the curry sauce. Whisk all remaining ingredients in a bowl, breaking up any clumps of coconut cream or curry paste. Taste for seasoning and add more of any ingredient to taste.
5. Add the curry sauce to the veggies once they are cooked and simmer for a few minutes until hot. Add the tofu at any time once it’s fully cooked, or leave it on the side if you prefer.
6. Serve the curry over rice.
