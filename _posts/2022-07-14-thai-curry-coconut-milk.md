Admittedly it’s been a long time (months, somehow) since I last posted. I’ll blame this on moving houses and busy times at work but the other equal reality is that sometimes I get in a food rut and either don’t cook anything new, cook new things that aren’t good enough to share, or forget to write down a recipe and can’t re-create it. This Thai curry is a staple for when I’m feeling uncreative or rushed, as it’s quick and crowd pleasing. You can use any variety of seasonal vegetables which makes it a great option to handle the variety from our summer CSA share. Broccoli is a favorite as it really absorbs the flavor of the curry sauce; we also love summer squash, bell peppers, and snow peas in this.

Summary of steps:

1. Make rice
2. Cook tofu
3. Cook veggies while preparing curry sauce
4. Simmer veggies and tofu in sauce

</div><div class="recipe-card-directions">### Directions

- Cook the rice according to the instructions.
- Heat a tbsp of avocado oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. While it’s heating, toss the tofu cubes with 1 tsp garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp salt until coated. When the pan is hot, add the tofu and cook for 10-15 minutes total, tossing every 3-4 minutes to cook all sides.
- Heat another tbsp of avocado oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the onion and your chopped veggies and stir. Cover the pot and let the veggies cook for 10-15 minutes or until they are soft but still retain a bit of crunch. Depending on the veggies you use, you should add them in stages – start with ones that take longer such as sweet potato or broccoli, and add things like mushrooms or green onions toward the end.
- While everything is cooking, prepare the curry sauce. Whisk all remaining ingredients in a bowl, breaking up any clumps of coconut cream or curry paste. Taste for seasoning and add more of any ingredient to taste.
- Add the curry sauce to the veggies once they are cooked and simmer for a few minutes until hot. Add the tofu at any time once it’s fully cooked, or leave it on the side if you prefer.
- Serve the curry over rice.
