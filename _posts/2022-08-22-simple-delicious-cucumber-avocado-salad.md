This deceptively delicious salad is the perfect addition to a summer meal. Lightly adapted from [Smitten Kitchen](https://smittenkitchen.com/2015/04/obsessively-good-avocado-cucumber-salad/) to be vegan, it’s just as obsessive and craveable as advertised. I used to slightly dread the cucumber overload from our summer CSA (how many green salads can we eat before I never want to see lettuce again?), but no more – this is one I’ll happily eat all summer.

Summary of steps:

1. Prepare the dressing
2. Assemble salad
