This is one of our favorite lunches to meal prep and enjoy all week. The blackened tempeh is flavorful and nutritionally awesome, the coconut bacon is sweet and salty, and the (oil-free!) cashew caesar dressing ties everything together.

Based on a recipe from [Cafe Gratitude's cookbook](https://cafegratitude.com/products/love-is-served-cookbook), this also makes a great wrap.
