This recipe is one of those that takes simple ingredients and turns them into something craveable. It's a great option for a weeknight dinner or to meal prep as most of the components require little active time. Inspired by a recipe in [Bryant Terry's Vegetable Kingdom](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/564101/vegetable-kingdom-by-bryant-terry/), I simplified some of the preparation and added rice and lentils to make this a more substantial meal. The infused vinegar really brings the dish together so be generous with it!

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 5 or 6 medium sized Yukon gold potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1 lb carrots (about 8 medium sized carrots), peeled and cut into 1-inch segments
- 1 tbsp. brown mustard seeds
- 1/2 tsp. chili flakes
- 1 tsp. sugar
- 1/2 of a medium sized cabbage, thinly sliced
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper

**For the jalapeno-ginger vinegar**
- 3 jalapeno peppers, stemmed, seeded, and chopped into large pieces
- 1.5 tsp. freshly grated ginger
- 1/2 cup plain rice vinegar
- 1/2 cup white vinegar
- 1 tsp. sugar
- Pinch of salt

**For serving**
- 1 cup cooked brown rice or grain of your choice
- 1.5 cups cooked green lentils
- Chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves, for garnish

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Preheat the oven to 450&deg;F and place silicone baking mats or parchment paper on three baking trays. Toss the potatoes in some olive oil and spread them out over two of the trays, and do the same with the carrots on the last tray. When the oven is preheated, place the trays on racks and bake for 20-25 minutes until the potatoes are crispy and carrots are beginning to char. Remove from the oven, sprinkle generously with salt and pepper, and set aside.
2. While the veggies are roasting, make the jalapeno-ginger vinegar. Heat the vinegars, ginger, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan until boiling. Then remove from heat, add the jalapenos, and let cool completely before straining into a jar.
3. In a large saute pan over medium heat, add about 2 tbsp. of olive oil and the mustard seeds, red pepper flakes, sugar, and 1/2 tsp. salt. Stir for about 2 minutes and then add the cabbage. Saute for another 3 minutes or so until the cabbage is wilted, then add 1/4 cup of water and cover the pan, cooking for another 4 minutes until the water is mostly absorbed. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
4. Divide the rice and lentils into two bowls and top with helpings of roasted potatoes, carrots, and the sauteed cabbage. Dress the bowl with a tablespoon or two of the jalapeno-ginger vinegar and garnish with parsley leaves.
