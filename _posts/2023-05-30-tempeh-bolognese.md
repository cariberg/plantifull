This super simple recipe, adapted from [Minimalist Baker](https://minimalistbaker.com/1-pan-tempeh-bolognese/#wprm-recipe-container-40804), has an impressively deep flavor and is nutritionally awesome thanks to the tempeh. If you're cooking to impress, [this more involved bolognese]({% post_url 2021-11-15-mushroom-lentil-beet-bolognese %}) is well worth the effort, but for a quick weeknight option we love this tempeh dish! We recommend serving this alongside a roasted veg like broccoli or a green salad.

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 16 oz. package of dried pasta
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 8 oz. cremini or white mushrooms, minced
- 2 x 8-oz. packages of tempeh, grated on a box grater
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 tsp. chili flakes
- 3 tbsp. tomato paste
- 2 tbsp. soy sauce or tamari
- 1 28-oz. can crushed tomatoes
- 1 tsp. dried oregano
- 1 tbsp. maple syrup or other sweetener
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and black pepper

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat for the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and cook according to instructions until done, then drain and set aside.
2. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Heat a tbsp. or so of olive oil in a dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the onion and saute for 4-5 minutes until soft, stirring occasionally. Add the mushrooms, tempeh, garlic, chili flakes, and tomato paste and cook for another 4-5 minutes until the tempeh is browning, stirring frequently and adding a bit of water if needed.
3. Add the soy sauce or tamari and scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the pot before adding the crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, and sweetener. Thin with water if needed and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Serve the pasta with a generous helping of sauce on top and garnish with additional dried or fresh herbs, if you like.
