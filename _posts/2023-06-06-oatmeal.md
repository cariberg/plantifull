Oatmeal tends to get a bad rap as boring and bland, but here's my hot take: that's only true if you let it be. I make oatmeal nearly every day for breakfast, and I do sometimes vary the toppings but usually stick pretty close to this recipe. The walnuts, chia, and flaxseeds provide awesome omega-3s and additional protein, and the splash of cold non-dairy milk before serving is my secret weapon - it really lightens up the meal!

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 1 cup water
- 1/2 cup rolled quick oats
- 1 tbsp. ground flaxseeds
- 1-2 tsp. maple syrup
- 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon
- Pinch of salt
- 3 tbsp. walnuts, chopped (pecans are also delicious here)
- 1 tbsp. chia seeds
- 1/4 cup blueberries (when blueberries aren't in season I often substitute sliced bananas)
- 1/3 cup soymilk or other non-dairy milk

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. In a small saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Then add the oats and flaxseeds and stir, lowering the heat to a simmer. Let cook for 1-4 minutes (the time will depend on your specific oats) or until most of the water is absorbed and the oats are tender.
2. Stir in the maple syrup, cinnamon, and pinch of salt before transferring the oats to a bowl. Top with walnuts, chia seeds, blueberries, and the non-dairy milk.
