This is a great approximation of a traditional egg-based quiche, perfect for when you're hosting brunch. The recipe is based on one from [Cafe Gratitude's cookbook](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/598239/love-is-served-by-cafe-gratitude-with-seizan-dreux-ellis/), with a few modifications including the addition of veggie breakfast sausages which I feel make the dish much more exciting. The quiche is really filling and easily modified with whatever vegetables you want to add. We serve this with fresh herbs on top or sometimes a basil pesto, which complements nicely.

Note: this recipe requires a very small bit of pre-work to mix the chickpea flour and water several hours before making the quiche.

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 2 cups chickpea flour
- 2 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
- 1.5 tsp. salt
- 2 tbsp. nutritional yeast
- 1/2 tsp. ground turmeric
- 1/4 tsp. paprika
- 4-6 veggie sausages, such as Beyond's Breakfast Sausage Patties
- 1/2 a red onion, diced
- 4 cups spinach, roughly chopped
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes, sliced in half
- 2 tbsp. fresh herbs such as dill, parsley, or basil, chopped

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Several hours or the night before you intend to make the quiche, whisk the chickpea flour with 3 cups of water in a medium bowl. Cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight. Skim off any foam from the top and whisk in 1 tbsp. of olive oil, the salt, nutritional yeast, ground turmeric, and paprika.
2. Preheat your oven to 350&deg;F.
3. Heat a large cast-iron skillet or dutch oven to medium heat on the stove and cook the veggie sausage as instructed. When done, remove from the pan and cut the sausages into roughly bite-size pieces. Set aside.
4. In the skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tbsp. of olive oil and add the diced onion. Cook for a few minutes until lightly browned, then add the chopped spinach and half of the chickpea batter. Without stirring, cook for 2-3 minutes until the spinach is slightly wilting. Then add the cherry tomatoes and sausages, scattering them evenly over the surface. Finally, add the remaining chickpea batter.
5. Let the quiche cook for about 5 more minutes, until the edges begin to solidify. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake for 40 minutes until the center is firm. Let the quiche rest for 10 minutes after removing it from the oven, during which time it will continue to set.
6. Sprinkle fresh herbs over the quiche and serve.
