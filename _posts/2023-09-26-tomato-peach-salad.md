It's somehow the end of September but thankfully the peaches and tomatoes here in Colorado are still going strong. We've been getting so many tomatoes from our farm share and most of them have ended up sliced and eaten with very little fanfare. This recipe is a simple way to honor great summer produce. You could serve this on toasted bread as an appetizer, or it goes well alongside any summer meal such as our favorite [easiest beet and lentil burgers]({% post_url 2021-11-04-easiest-beet-lentil-burgers %}). I highly recommend breaking out the nice balsamic vinegar and olive oil for this one!

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 1 or 2 heirloom tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1 yellow or white peach, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 3 medium fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced
- 1/2 tbsp. balsamic vinegar
- 1/2 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
- Flaky sea salt

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Gently mix the cubed tomatoes, peaches, and sliced basil in a bowl. Drizzle with vinegar and oil, and sprinkle with salt.
