Now that it's fall, I've been craving comfort food. Warm dishes with lots of spice always seem to hit the spot, and this creamy, flavorful black lentil dal from [Richa Hingleâ€™s cookbook](https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook) is a great option while still being super clean and healthy. I made a few modifications to make the recipe more weeknight-friendly; we usually serve this over rice and with a roasted or sauteed vegetable on the side.

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 1.5 cups dried black lentils, rinsed
- 1/2 tsp. cayenne powder
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 tsp. cumin seeds
- 2 jalapenos or other green chile, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp. grated ginger
- 6 cloves garlic, grated or minced
- 2 medium tomatoes, chopped
- 1/2 tsp. ground turmeric
- 1 tsp. garam masala
- 1/2 tsp. fenugreek seeds
- 1/2 cup coconut milk
- Avocado oil
- Salt
- Rice, for serving

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Combine the lentils, cayenne powder, and 1 tsp. salt in the insert of an Instant Pot. Add enough water to cover the lentils by an inch or two and set to pressure cook for 6 minutes, followed by a 10 minute slow release. Drain the lentils and reserve the cooking water.
2. While the lentils are cooking, heat a splash of avocado oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When hot, add the onion and cook for 4-6 minutes until soft. Then add the cumin seeds, chiles, ginger, and garlic and cook for another minute or two until the onion is translucent and the spices are aromatic.
3. Add the tomatoes and turmeric and cook for about another 7 minutes until the tomatoes are very soft. Then add the lentils to the skillet along with the garam masala, fenugreek seeds, and coconut milk. Stir in 1/2 tsp. salt and about 3/4 cup of lentil cooking water until the consistency is creamy but not too thin.
4. Simmer on low heat for at least 10 and up to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding water if needed to thin. Serve hot over rice.
