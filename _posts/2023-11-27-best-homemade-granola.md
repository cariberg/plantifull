As a kid, I loved eating cereal for breakfast. I no longer have the sweet tooth I used to, and could definitely not stomach Cocoa Puffs at 7am, but there's something great about a bowl of granola - lots of variety, a little sweet, simple and refreshing compared to hot cereal or a heavier breakfast like [tofu scramble]({% post_url 2021-04-22-breakfast-tofu-scramble %}) or [chickpea quiche]({% post_url 2023-09-19-chickpea-quiche %}). This granola is super simple to make and leaves room for all kinds of variation. Sometimes I'll add coconut flakes or even chocolate chips if I'm feeling like a throwback to my Cocoa Puff days. 

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 4 cups rolled or quick oats (See Note)
- 1 cup pecans
- 1/2 cup pepitas or sunflower seeds
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
- 1/3 cup melted coconut oil
- 1/3 cup natural peanut butter
- 1/3 cup maple syrup
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1 cup dried cranberries

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F and line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper.
2. Combine the oats, nuts and seeds, salt, and cinnamon in a large bowl. In a smaller bowl, mix together the melted coconut oil, peanut butter, maple syrup, and vanilla. Stir the wet mixture into the oats until completely mixed.
3. Spread the granola onto the prepared baking sheet in an even layer and bake for 22 minutes, stirring once halfway through.
4. Let the granola cool completely and then mix in the dried cranberries before transferring to a large container to store.
5. Serve granola with non-dairy milk, on top of an acai bowl or non-dairy yogurt, or however you like!
