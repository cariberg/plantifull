For Thanksgiving this year, we decided to make Alexa Weibel's [Mushroom Wellington](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020596-vegetarian-mushroom-wellington) since it was taking my Instagram feed by storm. Mushrooms are always a hit, and we thought it would be a more decadent and showstopping vegan main course than the lentil loaf or stews we've made in the past. I made a few modifications to simplify the recipe. The dish did not disappoint, and was surprisingly simple to make while looking absolutely stunning. I've renamed it mushrooms in puff pastry because I think the dish stands on its own and deserves to break free from any association with beef! 

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 3 lbs cremini mushrooms
- 4 shallots, diced
- 6 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp. fresh rosemary, minced
- 3 tbsp. balsamic vinegar, divided
- 2 tbsp. soy sauce
- 1 tsp. dried thyme
- 1 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped
- 3 tbsp. vegan butter, such as Miyoko's
- 2 onions, cut in half and then thinly sliced
- 3/4 tsp. brown sugar
- 1 cup apple cider
- 17-oz of puff pastry sheets, such as Pepperidge Farm (See Note)
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. In a food processor with an S-blade, chop the mushrooms in batches by pulsing a few times, then transferring the chopped mushrooms to a medium sized bowl. A mix of sizes is best, with the smallest pieces being roughly 1/4 inches and the largest roughly 1/2 inch.
2. In a large skillet, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add half of the mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and rosemary and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes until the mushrooms have released all their water and are starting to brown. Season with salt and pepper, then transfer to a bowl. 
3. Repeat step 2 with the remaining mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and rosemary. Then return the first batch of mushrooms to the skillet and add 2 tbsp. of balsamic vinegar, the soy sauce, and the thyme. Cook for another minute or two until the liquid evaporates, then transfer the mixture to a bowl and stir in the walnuts.
4. Place the bowl with the mushroom mixture in the fridge to cool for at least 1 hour. You can also speed this process up by placing the bowl in the freezer for about 20 minutes and stirring every few minutes.
5. In the same skillet, melt the vegan butter over medium heat and add the onions and sugar along with 1 tsp. salt and 3/4 tsp. black pepper. After cooking for about 5 minutes, add the apple cider and cook for another 15 minutes or so, stirring occasionally, until the onions are caramelized. Stir in 1 tbsp. of balsamic vinegar and remove from the heat to cool.
6. Preheat the oven to 400&deg;F. Sprinkle some flour onto a silicone baking mat or piece of parchment paper and unfold the thawed puff pastry sheet(s) onto it. With a rolling pin, roll the sheet(s) into a rectangle about 13 by 16 inches. If you have multiple sheets of pastry, be sure to press the edges together or use a fork to seal the seam tightly.
7. Transfer the silicone mat and puff pastry to a baking tray and form a loaf shape using half of the mushroom mixture. Layer the onions on top of the first half of the mushroom mixture, then the rest of the mushrooms on top of the onions. Refer to this simplified visual for help with the orientation and placement of the fillings.

8. Take one of the longer overhanging sides of the pastry and gently stretch it over the top of the filling. Brush a little olive oil on the pastry and then repeat with the other side, pressing it down to seal. Similarly, seal the short ends using olive oil and tuck them underneath.
9. Brush the top of the puff pastry with more olive oil. To decorate, use a sharp knife to carefully slice through only the top layer of pastry in a pattern - I went with arcing cuts from the center to the outside of the pastry, but you could do parallel or cross-hatching lines as well.
10. Bake the mushrooms in puff pastry for 45-50 minutes or until the pastry is flaky and golden.

**Notes**
- Most store-bought puff pastry that I've seen is made with vegetable oils and so is vegan, but double check the brand before you purchase it. If using homemade puff pastry I applaud you, just be sure to use vegan butter in your recipe.
- If you eat eggs, you can use egg wash instead of olive oil in steps 8-9 to brush the surface of the puff pastry - it will produce a richer golden color for your showstopper.
