Winter is here and that means baking (and eating) lots of sweet treats! These chocolate cupcakes, adapted from [The First Mess cookbook](https://thefirstmess.com/cookbook/the-first-mess-cookbook/), are craveable and decadent, especially with the maple caramel drizzled on top. I recommend topping the cupcakes with the whipped coconut cream and maple caramel just before serving, as the toppings are a bit thin compared to a buttercream or traditional icing.

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

**For the cupcakes**
- 1 1/4 cups of spelt or all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup fine ground almond flour
- 3/4 cup cocoa powder
- 1 tsp. baking powder
- 1 tsp. baking soda
- 1/4 tsp. salt
- 1 cup unsweetened soy or almond milk
- 1 tsp. apple cider vinegar or lemon juice
- 3/4 cup maple syrup
- 1/3 cup coconut oil, melted
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup hot water

**For the whipped coconut cream**
- 1 can coconut cream, chilled in the refrigerator
- 1 tbsp. maple syrup
- 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract

**For the maple caramel**
- 1/2 cup coconut milk
- 3/8 cup maple syrup
- 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp. lemon juice
- 1/4 tsp. salt

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Preheat your oven to 350&deg;F and line two muffin tins with cupcake liners, or grease them with a neutral oil.
2. Whisk the dry ingredients together in a large bowl: spelt and almond flours, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. Mix the non-dairy milk and apple cider vinegar or lemon juice together in a small bowl and set aside for a couple minutes.
4. Add the maple syrup, coconut oil, vanilla, and hot water to the dry ingredients, then add the non-dairy milk mixture. Stir the batter until all the flour is absorbed.
5. Transfer the batter into the cupcake liners - you should have between 12-18 depending on the size of your pans - and place the pans in the oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until a test toothpick comes out cleanly. Let the cupcakes cool completely.
6. While the cupcakes are baking, make the caramel. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the coconut milk and maple syrup and bring to a boil. Then, lower to a simmer and let cook for about 15 minutes, whisking every few minutes, until the caramel has reduced and thickened.
7. Stir into the warm caramel the vanilla, lemon juice, and salt, then transfer the mixture to a glass container. Once cool, refrigerate until you're ready to serve the cupcakes.
8. Make the whipped coconut cream. Use a spoon to scoop the chilled coconut cream out of its can and into the pitcher of a high-speed blender, avoiding any coconut water that remains at the bottom of the can. Add the maple syrup and vanilla and whip until you have a smooth cream. Place in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve the cupcakes.
9. Just before serving, top each cupcake with a dollop of coconut cream and drizzle with maple caramel.
