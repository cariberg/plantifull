This recipe is one of our go-to weeknight meals and also one that we'd happily serve even tofu-skeptical guests for a casual dinner. The chili crisp marinade/sauce is spicy and flavorful, and goes perfectly with the tofu and crispy roasted broccoli. Based on a recipe from Sam Sifton in [NYT Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020993-tofu-and-green-beans-with-chile-crisp), it also requires very little active time. As written, this is 4-6 servings so feel free to reduce the quantities as needed.

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 3 cloves garlic, grated
- 2 tbsp. grated ginger
- 1/4 cup tamari or soy sauce
- 1-4 tbsp. chili crisp (depending on your spice preference)
- 1 tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar
- 2 tsp. toasted sesame oil
- 1 tsp. honey or agave nectar
- 3 14-oz. packages firm or extra-firm tofu, each one pressed to remove water and sliced into 3 ~1/2 inch "steaks"
- 2 large heads of broccoli, chopped into florets
- 4 scallions, sliced
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt & black pepper
- Cooked rice, for serving

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Preheat the oven to 400&deg;F and line three baking sheets with silicone mats or parchment paper.
2. Combine the garlic, ginger, tamari, chili crisp, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and honey in a small bowl and whisk to combine.
3. Spoon ~2 tbsp. of the marinade onto each baking tray and spread it around in the center of the tray. Then, place 3 slices of tofu in a row in the center of each tray on top of the sauce. Top each piece of tofu with another small spoonful of the marinade and spread it around to cover the tofu. Scatter a few scallions over each piece of tofu.
4. Toss the broccoli in a tbsp. or so of olive oil and then spread it along the outsides of the trays.
5. Place the trays in the oven and roast for about 20 minutes, until the broccoli is crispy. Remove from the oven. Serve the tofu and broccoli over your choice of rice, with any extra marinade and scallions, and more chili crisp on the side.
