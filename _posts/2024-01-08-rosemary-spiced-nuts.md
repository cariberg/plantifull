Over the holidays we had family staying with us, and it was really fun to have everyone under one roof for a week. In advance, I made a few snacks and treats to have around the house, to help with the festive atmosphere and equally importantly, to prevent any hangry confrontations. These nuts, adapted from a [Smitten Kitchen](https://smittenkitchen.com/2016/12/union-square-cafes-bar-nuts/) recipe, are always a huge hit. Just be warned, they're nearly impossible to stop eating and have been known to ruin appetites before dinner!

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 3 1/2 cups of raw, unsalted mixed nuts (if you buy roasted nuts, skip step two below)
- 1 tbsp. vegan butter, such as Miyoko's, melted
- 2-3 tbsp. finely chopped fresh rosemary
- 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
- 1 1/2 tsp. maple syrup
- 3/4 tsp. salt

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F and line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper.
2. Spread the nuts onto the tray and toast for about 8 minutes, until lightly fragrant.
3. Meanwhile, mix all other ingredients together in a large bowl. When the nuts are toasted, remove them from the oven (but leave the oven on) and add them to the herb butter mixture, stirring to coat.
4. Spread the nuts out onto the tray again and roast for another 8 minutes or until the rosemary is very fragrant.
