It has been *cold* in Colorado recently! We've been on a major soup kick as a result, making all of our most comforting favorites. This sweet potato peanut soup, based on a recipe from [Sweet Peas and Saffron](https://sweetpeasandsaffron.com/african-peanut-stew), is great for cold nights- hearty and warming, and it comes together quickly in the Instant Pot. 

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 4-5 cups of cubed sweet potatoes (about 2 medium potatoes)
- 1 onion, diced
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp. ginger, grated
- 4 cups cooked chickpeas
- 4 cups vegetable stock
- 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes
- 1/2 cup natural peanut butter
- 1 tsp. ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp. ground coriander
- 1/4-1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1 cup water
- 4 packed cups spinach leaves
- Juice from 1/2 of a lime

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Combine all ingredients except for the spinach and the lime juice into the insert of an Instant Pot and stir well. Place the insert in the Instant Pot and cook on high pressure for 6 minutes, then allow to slow release for another 10 minutes before de-pressuring.
2. Stir in the spinach and lime juice, and then season for salt, lime, and spice.
