Last week I had to travel for work, and when I got home I was so excited for home-cooked food again. Thankfully it's easier than it used to be to eat plant-based even when on the road, but I was craving something clean, flavorful, and filling. This recipe, adapted from [Richa Hingle's cookbook](https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook/), is a delicious take on a classic dish you can find at just about any Indian restaurant. We've made this before with tofu instead of the tempeh and it's equally good.

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 1 red onion, diced
- 2 8-oz. blocks of tempeh, cut into small ~1/3-inch cubes
- 1.5 tsp. Garam Masala
- 3/4 tsp. paprika
- 1.5 tsp. ground coriander
- 1.5 tsp. fenugreek seeds
- 3/4 tsp. ground turmeric
- 3 large tomatoes, chopped (about 3 cups)
- 1 tbsp. ginger, chopped
- 6 cloves garlic
- 1 jalapeno or other green chile, seeds removed and chopped
- 1/2 cup coconut milk
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 tsp. apple cider vinegar
- Salt
- Avocado oil
- Cooked rice, for serving

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. In a large pot or skillet, heat a splash of avocado oil over medium heat. When hot, add the red onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes or until translucent. Then add the cubed tempeh and stir to combine. Let cook for another 3-5 minutes until the tempeh is browning and the onions are golden.
2. Meanwhile, combine the chopped tomatoes, ginger, garlic, and jalapeno in a blender and blend into a smooth puree.
3. Add the spices to the onions and tempeh in the pot: Garam Masala, paprika, coriander, fenugreek, and turmeric. Stir to coat and let cook for another 2 minutes.
4. Add the tomato puree to the pot and stir to combine. Cook for about 10 minutes until the sauce has thickened and the flavor of the tomato and jalapeno have mellowed.
5. Add the coconut milk, water, apple cider vinegar, and 3/4 tsp. of salt to the pot and stir. Cook for another 10 minutes until the sauce has thickened to your desired consistency. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.
6. Serve over rice and alongside a simple roasted veggie.
