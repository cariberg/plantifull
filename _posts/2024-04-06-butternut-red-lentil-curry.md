This is yet another weeknight-friendly crowd pleaser adapted from [Richa Hingleâ€™s cookbook](https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook). The sweetness from the coconut milk and squash is complemented by the warming spices in the Garam Masala. This curry is delicious served over rice, and we usually pair it with a simple roasted vegetable or green salad.


<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 1/2 tsp. black mustard seeds
- 5 bay leaves
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1.5 cups of diced butternut squash (from about 1/2 a medium sized squash)
- 1/4 cup dried shredded coconut
- 1/4 tsp. cayenne
- 1/2 tsp. Garam Masala
- 1 cup dried red lentils, rinsed and drained
- 1/2 cup coconut milk
- 2.5 cups water
- 3/4 tsp. salt
- Avocado oil
- Rice, for serving
- Fresh lemon juice, for garnish

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Heat a generous splash of avocado oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the mustard seeds and curry leaves and cook for 30 seconds to a minute, until the seeds begin to sizzle. Add the garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. Then add the diced squash and toss to coat. Cover the pot and cook for 5 minutes.
2. Remove the lid and add the coconut, cayenne, and Garam Masala. Then add the lentils, coconut milk, water, and salt. Stir well to combine, then cover and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 15-20 minutes or until the lentils and squash are tender.
3. Serve over rice with a dash of lemon juice.
