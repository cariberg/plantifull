This time of year in Denver, the weather can't decide if it's spring or still winter. We'll have a gorgeous 75-degree day immediately followed by a cold snap (or in the case of last weekend, insane wind storms that rip out fences and scatter outdoor furniture). This soup is perfect for those return-to-winter nights, and honestly still really good on a warmer day. Adapted from [Laura Wright's one pot minestrone](https://thefirstmess.com/2024/01/05/vegan-minestrone-soup/), this recipe is flexible and a great way to use up whatever leftover veggies you might have in the fridge!

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 1 medium carrot, diced
- 1 stalk of celery, diced
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tsp. dried rosemary
- 1/2 tsp. dried oregano
- 1/4 tsp. smoked paprika
- 1/4-1/2 tsp. dried chili flakes
- 2 tbsp. tomato paste
- 2 medium potatoes, cubed
- 1.5 cups chopped green cabbage
- 3 cups cooked beans (we used borlotti beans in the photo shown, but chickpeas or any white bean would also be great here)
- 1 14-oz. can of fire-roasted tomatoes
- 4 cups vegetable stock
- 1.5 cups chopped green beans
- 3/4 cup dried pasta - use a smaller shape like elbows here
- 1.5 tsp. miso paste
- 1/2 cup chopped parsley
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and black pepper

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Heat a splash of olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the onion, carrot, and celery and saute for 7-10 minutes until the veggies are very soft but not yet browning.
2. Add the garlic, rosemary, oregano, smoked paprika, chili flakes, and tomato paste and stir well. Cook for 1-2 minutes until very fragrant.
3. Add the potatoes, cabbage, beans, tomatoes, and stock and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cover. Cook for 12-14 minutes or until the potatoes are just tender.
4. Add the green beans and pasta and stir. Cover again and simmer until the pasta is cooked, about 12 more minutes. Once the pasta is cooked, turn off the heat.
5. In a small bowl, ladle out about a half cup of the hot soup liquid from the pot. Add the miso paste and whisk to combine until the miso is fully dissolved. Return this mixture to the pot and stir.
6. Add the parsley to the soup and stir. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper before serving.
