I've been hearing lately about how [cabbage is having a moment](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/10/briefing/cabbage-culinary-star.html). As far as I'm concerned cabbage has always been a winner, but I'm glad the rest of the world is finally giving it the recognition it deserves. This weeknight-friendly meal featuring roasted cabbage - one of my favorite ways to prepare cabbage! - is packed with flavor, and fancy enough to serve guests. Adapted from [Laura Wright's original](https://thefirstmess.com/2019/05/22/cabbage-steaks-jalapeno-chimichurri/#recipe), we prefer roasting the cabbage because that way it's ok if the slices fall apart.

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 1 medium green cabbage, sliced into 1-inch 'steaks'
- 1 1/4 cup black lentils, rinsed
- Extra virgin olive oil

For the steak seasoning (makes extra):
- 2 tsp. ground black pepper
- 2 tsp. paprika
- 2 tsp. salt
- 1 tsp. garlic powder
- 1 tsp. onion powder
- 1/2 - 1 tsp. cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp. coriander

For the chimichurri:
- 2 cups flat leaf parsley, chopped
- 1 jalapeno, seeded and minced
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1.5 tbsp. capers, minced
- 3 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tbsp. lemon juice
- 1 tsp. salt
- Pinch of chili flakes

For the tahini sauce:
- 1/4 cup tahini
- 1 tbsp. lemon juice
- 1 tbsp. maple syrup
- 1 tbsp. grainy mustard
- 1/3 cup water

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F.

2. Cook the lentils. If using an Instant Pot, pressure cook for about 7 minutes followed by a 10-minute slow release. Drain the lentils and set aside.

2. While the lentils are cooking, mix together all the spices for the steak seasoning. Then place the cabbage slices on a baking tray and spray or brush with a light coat of olive oil. Sprinkle with the steak seasoning, then flip the cabbage over and repeat on the other side. Roast the cabbage for 16 minutes in the 375&deg;F oven until the cabbage is tender and the edges are beginning to brown or get crispy.

3. While things are cooking, prepare the chimichurri by mixing together all ingredients.

4. While things are cooking, prepare the tahini sauce by whisking together all ingredients.

5. To serve, place a helping of cabbage and lentils on a plate and top the lentils with chimichurri. Drizzle with tahini sauce.
