Last weekend I had the opportunity to go out to the [farm](https://www.monroefarm.com/) where we are CSA members and pick asparagus, one of my favorite spring veggies. Fun fact: asparagus can grow 6 inches per day in the spring! I would only use very fresh asparagus (like from a farmers' market) in this recipe - if you don't have access to super fresh asparagus, I'd recommend roasting, searing, or grilling yours instead of leaving it raw, and serving this as a warm or room temperature salad.

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 1 lb. fresh asparagus stalks
- 1/2 cup fresh bread crumbs
- Pinch of garlic powder
- Zest from 1 lemon
- Juice from 1 lemon
- 1 small garlic clove, minced
- 1/4 tsp. Dijon mustard
- 1/4 tsp. sugar
- 2 tbsp. avocado or other neutral oil
- 1/3 cup walnuts, chopped
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. In a small frying pan over medium-low heat, warm a few tsp. of olive oil. Once hot, add the bread crumbs, pinch of garlic powder, and a pinch of salt. Let cook, stirring often, until the bread crumbs are crispy and fragrant. Remove from the pan and set aside.

2. In the same pan over medium heat, toast the walnuts for 3-5 minutes or until fragrant, stirring to ensure even toasting. Remove and set aside.

3. Using a vegetable peeler or a mandoline, shave the asparagus into thin ribbons. It's ok if they break or you can't get the last ones from each stalk super thin. Place the asparagus ribbons into a medium sized bowl.

4. In a small jar, combine the lemon juice, garlic clove, mustard, sugar, and avocado oil and shake or stir to emulsify the dressing. Add salt to taste.

5. Dress the asparagus with the lemon dressing (you may not use all the dressing), tossing gently to combine. Top with toasted walnuts, bread crumbs, and lemon zest.
