This deceptively delicious salad is the perfect addition to a summer meal. Adapted from a few recipes including [Smitten Kitchen's](https://smittenkitchen.com/2015/04/obsessively-good-avocado-cucumber-salad/) and [NYT Cooking's](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022411-cucumber-avocado-salad), it’s a craveable and refreshing addition to any summer dinner. I used to slightly dread the cucumber overload from our summer CSA, but no more – this is a dish I’ll happily eat all summer.

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 2 medium cucumbers, diced into ~1/4-inch cubes (yields about 3 cups of chopped cucumber)
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/4 cup raw cashews, soaked for 4+ hours
- 1 tbsp. lemon juice
- 3 scallions, thinly sliced OR 1/4 cup white onion, small diced
- 1 large avocado, diced
- 1/4 tsp. chili flakes
- 1/4 cup flat leaf parsley, chopped

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Place the diced cucumbers in a colander and sprinkle with the salt. Let sit for 5-15 minutes while you prepare the remaining ingredients.
2. Prepare the dressing: in a high-speed blender, combine the raw cashews with 4 tbsp. of water and the lemon juice. Blend until smooth, adding more water if needed until you have a thin but creamy consistency (think heavy cream).
3. Shake any excess water off the cucumbers and transfer to a medium bowl. Add all remaining ingredients and the dressing, and fold together. Adjust seasonings with salt and more chili flakes as desired.
