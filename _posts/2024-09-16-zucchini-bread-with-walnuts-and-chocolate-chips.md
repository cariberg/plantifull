This is a delicious, moist vegan take on zucchini bread without being too sweet! Adapted 
(and made easier) from [Laura Wright's First Mess recipe](https://thefirstmess.com/2020/08/12/vegan-spelt-zucchini-bread-recipe/#recipe), 
this is a great dessert or even a pre-run snack as a muffins (my preferred style!).
