This is a delicious, moist vegan take on zucchini bread without being too sweet! Adapted 
from [Laura Wright's First Mess recipe](https://thefirstmess.com/2020/09/30/vegan-spelt-pumpkin-bread/), 
this is a great dessert or even a pre-run snack as a muffin (my preferred style!). Laura's recipe calls 
for either pumpkin seeds or walnuts, but the pumpkin seeds add an incongruous texture 
to the bread/muffins, so I recommend just using walnuts (and plenty of chocolate chips!).  

The recipe makes them as muffins, but it also could be made into a loaf. Just put into a 
loaf pan and cook for 50-55 minutes.
