Spring has sprung here in Denver, and we are admiring tulips, eating all the asparagus, and enjoying the warmer weather! We recently made this vegan chickpea salad for the first time and it's already becoming a staple lunch option for this time of year. The fresh, crunchy veggies really brighten up this salad, which is lightly adapted from the [Oh She Glows](https://ohsheglows.com/chickpea-salad/) original. We've been eating this in wraps or on toast, but you could also eat it with your favorite crackers or just as-is!

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 3 cups of cooked chickpeas
- 4 celery stalks, diced
- 5 green onions, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup red bell pepper, diced
- 5 tbsp vegan mayonnaise (we like [this one](https://followyourheart.com/vegan-foods/dairy-free-mayo/avocado-oil-vegenaise/))
- 1 tbsp yellow mustard
- 1.5 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp fresh dill (or 1 tsp dried dill)
- 1/2 tsp salt

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Using a potato masher, mash the chickpeas until they are somewhat flaky in texture.

2. Stir in all other ingredients and mix well. Adjust lemon juice, salt, and other seasonings to taste.
