This year's crop of asparagus from our CSA has been extra delicious. We've made our way through a few [favorite]({% post_url 2024-06-16-lemony-asparagus-salad %}) [preparations]({% post_url 2024-07-01-asparagus-tofu-stir-fry %}), and after seeing [NYT Cooking's recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1026745-skillet-gnocchi-with-miso-butter-and-asparagus) for gnocchi with asparagus I was inspired to create a vegan version. Our adaptation also includes white beans, which work nicely with the sauce and add some protein to the dish.

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 1 tbsp avocado oil
- 1 16-oz package of shelf-stable potato gnocchi
- 3 tbsp vegan butter such as [Miyoko's](https://www.miyokos.com/collections/vegan-butter/products/european-style-plant-milk-butter-unsalted?variant=34949102567578), melted
- 2 tbsp miso paste
- 2 tsp champagne, white wine, or sherry vinegar
- ~1 lb asparagus, trimmed and cut into ~1/2 inch pieces
- 1.5 cups cooked white beans
- 2 cups arugula
- Black pepper

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Heat the oil in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Add the gnocchi to the pan in an even layer, separating any that have stuck together. Cover and cook for 3-4 minutes until the gnocchi are golden brown and a bit crispy on the bottom.

2. While the gnocchi cooks, mix together the melted butter, miso paste, and vinegar. Add a few generous grinds of black pepper.

3. Add the asparagus and white beans to the pan with the gnocchi and cook for 2-4 minutes or until the asparagus are bright green and the beans are warmed through.

4. Turn off the heat and stir in the miso butter until everything is evenly coated in sauce. Stir in the arugula, adjust pepper and salt to taste, and serve.
