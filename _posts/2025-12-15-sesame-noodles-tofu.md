We love this dish because it's so flexible, and also has one of the most delicious and addictive sauces we've ever made. Based on [NYT Cooking's recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/9558-takeout-style-sesame-noodles), this sauce could be served as written with noodles, or over a rice bowl, or honestly you could probably put the sauce on just about anything and it would be good. The other ingredients are also flexible depending on what veggies and noodles you have.

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

For the sauce:
- 2 tbsp. toasted sesame oil
- 3.5 tbsp. tamari (for gluten free) or soy sauce
- 2 tbsp. rice vinegar
- 2 tbsp. sesame paste or tahini
- 1 tbsp. peanut butter
- 0.5 tsp. sugar
- 1 tbsp. grated ginger
- 2 tsp. grated garlic
- 2 tsp. chile crisp

For the tofu:
- 1 14-oz package of extra firm tofu, drained and pressed
- 1 tbsp. arrowroot powder
- 1 tbsp. avocado oil
- 1 tbsp. tamari (for gluten free) or soy sauce

For the dish:
- 10 oz. noodles (we like soba noodles or rice noodles)
- 4 cups veggies, chopped into bite size pieces (we like broccoli, cauliflower, and red onion)
- Extra virgin olive oil

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Preheat the oven to 400&deg;F. 

2. Toss the veggies in a few teaspoons of olive oil to coat, and spread over two baking sheets. Roast in the oven for 10-20 minutes, depending on your veggies, until browned.

3. Cut the drained and pressed tofu into cubes or squares. Toss in a bowl with the arrowroot powder, avocado oil, and tamari. Spread onto a silicone baking mat or parchment paper on a baking sheet and roast in the oven for 20 minutes, until crispy and browned.

4. Bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the noodles according to the instructions on the package. Drain and rinse with water to prevent sticking.

5. Combine all ingredients for the sauce in a blender, or use an immersion blender, and puree until smooth.

6. To serve, combine the noodles and veggies and toss together with the sauce. Add the tofu just before serving. Can be served hot or cold.
