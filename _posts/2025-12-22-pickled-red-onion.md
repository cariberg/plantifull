This is my go-to recipe for pickled red onions, and I nearly always have a jar in the fridge. They're perfect for brightening up a simple salad, a roasted veggie dish, or a grain bowl. You can substitute other types of vinegar easily here as well!

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 1 red onion, thinly sliced
- 2 tsp. salt
- 2 tsp. granulated sugar
- 3/8 cup red wine vinegar
- 3/8 cup apple cider vinegar


<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Combine all ingredients in a jar and tightly close the lid. Turn the jar and gently shake it to submerge the onions in the liquid.

2. Set aside for at least 30 minutes for a quick pickled onion, or store in the fridge for later use.
