This dish is a crowd pleaser that I'd make for even the most vegan-skeptical guests. Based on [Laura Wright's original](https://thefirstmess.com/2023/09/06/baked-pearl-couscous-with-butternut-squash-basil-tahini/), it's a very flavorful dish that is perfect for a cozy fall or winter night. Don't skip the [pickled red onions]({% post_url 2025-12-22-pickled-red-onion %}), which add some nice acidity!

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

For the squash and couscous bake:
- 1 shallot, sliced
- 1 medium-sized butternut squash, peeled and cut into ~2-inch pieces
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp. za'atar spice blend
- 1 tsp. smoked paprika
- 2 cups vegetable stock
- 1.5 cups pearl couscous
- 2.5 cups cooked chickpeas
- 1 tsp. lemon zest
- 1 tbsp. fresh lemon juice
- 2 cups spinach, chopped
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper

For the basil tahini sauce:
- 1/4 cup tahini
- 1/3 cup fresh basil
- 1 tbsp. fresh lemon juice

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Preheat the oven to 425&deg;F. 

2. In a 9x13-inch glass baking dish, mix the shallot, squash, garlic, za'atar, smoked paprika, along with a tablespoon or two of olive oil and generous pinches of salt and pepper. Bake in the oven for 25 minutes, stirring halfway through, until the squash is soft.

3. After the dish has been baking for about 20 minutes, bring the vegetable stock to a simmer in a small pot.

4. When the 25 minutes are up, remove the dish from the oven and add the simmering stock, couscous, chickpeas, and additional salt and pepper. Stir gently to combine and cover the dish tightly with foil. Return it to the oven and bake for another 20-25 minutes, until the couscous is soft and the stock is fully absorbed.

5. While the dish bakes, combine all ingredients for the tahini sauce in a blender and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper as needed.

6. When the dish is done baking, remove it from the oven and stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, and spinach. Stir until the spinach wilts, and season with additional salt and pepper as needed.

7. Serve hot, with pickled red onions and the basil tahini sauce on top.
