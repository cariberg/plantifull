This is a warming, hearty soup that's perfect for winter nights. I modified [Laura Wright's original](https://thefirstmess.com/2014/10/02/cauliflower-kale-chickpea-curry-pot-recipe/) to make this more filling, and because I prefer Swiss Chard to kale in soups like this. We love the combination of curry powder and ginger with a hearty tomato-ey soup!

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 1 large yellow onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tsp. fresh ginger, grated or minced
- 1 tbsp. curry powder
- 1/4 tsp. cayenne powder
- 1 medium potato, diced into ~1/2 inch pieces
- 3 cups of cauliflower florets
- 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes
- 4 cups vegetable stock
- 2.5 cups cooked chickpeas
- 1 bunch of Swiss chard, chopped
- Salt
- Black pepper
- Extra virgin olive oil


<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large pot on the stove over medium heat. Add the onions and cook for 5-7 minutes, until they are soft and translucent.

2. Add the garlic, ginger, curry and cayenne powders and cook for another 1-3 minutes, stirring constantly, until fragrant.

3. Stir in the cauliflower, potatoes, crushed tomatoes, and enough vegetable stock to cover everything (2-3 cups) to the pot. Season with 1/2 tsp. salt and a few generous grinds of black pepper.

4. Cover the pot and bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer and remove the lid. Cook for 35-40 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.

5. Add the chickpeas, chard, and as much remaining stock as you'd like to get it to your preferred consistency. Simmer for 5 more minutes or until the greens are wilted. Check for seasoning and then serve hot.
